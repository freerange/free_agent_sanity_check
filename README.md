This uses the [Free Agent wrapper](https://github.com/freerange/free_agent) to check for bank transactions in US Dollars that have incorrectly had VAT added.

I'm hoping that this 'app' will replace our current use of Jenkins to regularly run the list_usd_transactions_with_non_zero_vat example script.
