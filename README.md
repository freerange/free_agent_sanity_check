This respository is *DEPRECATED*.

The app used to schedule a simple cron job to check a [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com/) account for bank transactions in US Dollars that have incorrectly had VAT added. However, the app no longer works, because FreeAgent have phased out their v1 API. We've deleted all the code from the repository to discourage people from using it.

We now use the [FreeAgent Transaction Explainer](https://github.com/freerange/freeagent_transaction_explainer) Chrome extension to ensure we use the correct VAT rate for our recurring payments.
